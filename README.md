# thermal-feature-detection

 1.  A  novel  Triplet  based  network  to train robust feature detection on thermal scenes.  
 2.  A patch-based feature extraction network to learn 128-dimensional descriptor vectors to overcome the texture andcontext  limitation  of  the  thermal  scenes.   
 3.  Integration of the proposed detection and extraction networks into a  full  pipeline  to  enable  stable  and  reliable  feature  match-ing  on  thermal  images.   
 4.  Achieve  a  superior  perfor-mance in visual and quantitative comparison compared withother widely-used classical and most recent deep learning algorithms
